\title{
  Zellner Prior for Poisson Regression
}

\description{
  A Zellner-style spike and slab prior for Poisson regression models.
  See 'Details' for a definition.
}

\usage{
PoissonZellnerPrior(
    predictors,
    counts = NULL,
    exposure = NULL,
    prior.event.rate = NULL,
    expected.model.size = 1,
    prior.information.weight = .01,
    diagonal.shrinkage = .5,
    optional.coefficient.estimate = NULL,
    max.flips = -1,
    prior.inclusion.probabilities = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{predictors}{
    The design matrix for the regression problem.  No missing data is allowed.
  }

  \item{counts}{The vector of responses, This is only used to obtain the
    empirical overall event rate, so it can be left \code{NULL} if
    prior.event.rate is specified.  }

  \item{exposure}{A vector of the same length as \code{counts}, giving
    the "exposure time" for each observation.  This can also be
    \code{NULL}, signifying that \code{exposure = 1.0} for each
    observation.  }

  \item{prior.event.rate}{An a priori guess at the overall event rate.
    Used in two places: to set the prior mean of the intercept (if
    \code{optional.coefficient.estimate} is \code{NULL}) and to weight
    the information matrix in the "slab" portion of the prior.  }

  \item{expected.model.size}{
    A positive number less than \code{ncol(x)}, representing a guess at
    the number of significant predictor variables.  Used to obtain the
    'spike' portion of the spike and slab prior.
  }

  \item{prior.information.weight}{
    A positive scalar.  Number of observations worth of weight that
    should be given to the prior estimate of beta.
  }

  \item{diagonal.shrinkage}{
    The conditionally Gaussian prior for beta (the "slab") starts with a
    precision matrix equal to the information in a single observation.
    However, this matrix might not be full rank.  The matrix can be made
    full rank by averaging with its diagonal.  \code{diagonal.shrinkage}
    is the weight given to the diaonal in this average.  Setting this to
    zero gives Zellner's g-prior.
  }

  \item{optional.coefficient.estimate}{ If desired, an estimate of the
    regression coefficients can be supplied.  In most cases this will be
    a difficult parameter to specify.  If omitted then a prior mean of
    zero will be used for all coordinates except the intercept, which
    will be set to mean(y).  }

  \item{max.flips}{The maximum number of variable inclusion indicators
    the sampler will attempt to sample each iteration.  If negative then
    all indicators will be sampled.}

  \item{prior.inclusion.probabilities}{A vector giving the prior
    probability of inclusion for each variable.  If \code{NULL} then a
    default set of probabilities is obtained by setting each element
    equal to \code{min(1, expected.model.size / ncol(x))}.}

\details{ A Zellner-style spike and slab prior for Poisson regression.
Denote the vector of coefficients by \eqn{\beta}{beta}, and the vector
of inclusion indicators by \eqn{\gamma}{gamma}.  These are linked by the
relationship \eqn{\beta_i \ne 0}{beta[i] != 0} if \eqn{\gamma_i =
1}{gamma[i] = 1} and \eqn{\beta_i = 0}{beta[i] == 0} if \eqn{\gamma_i =
0}{gamma[i] = 0}.  The prior is

\deqn{\beta | \gamma \sim N(b, V)}{beta | gamma ~ N(b, V),}
\deqn{\gamma \sim B(\pi)}{gamma ~ Bernoulli(pi)}

where \eqn{\pi}{pi} is the vector of
\code{prior.inclusion.probabilities}, and \eqn{b} is the
\code{optional.coefficient.estimate}.  Conditional on
\eqn{\gamma}{gamma}, the prior information matrix is

\deqn{V^{-1} = \kappa ((1 - \alpha) x^Twx / n + \alpha diag(x^Twx / n))}{
  V^{-1} = kappa * ((1 - alpha) * x^Twx / n + alpha * diag(x^Twx/n))
}

The matrix \eqn{x^Twx} is, for suitable choice of the weight vector
\eqn{w}, the total Fisher information available in the data.
Dividing by \eqn{n} gives the average Fisher information in a single
observation, multiplying by \eqn{\kappa}{kappa} then results in
\eqn{\kappa}{kappa} units of "average" information.  This matrix is
averaged with its diagonal to ensure positive definiteness.

In the formula above, \eqn{\kappa}{kappa} is
\code{prior.information.weight}, \eqn{\alpha}{alpha} is
\code{diagonal.shrinkage}, and \eqn{w} is a diagonal matrix with all
elements set to \code{prior.success.probability * (1 -
  prior.success.probability)}.  The vector \eqn{b} and the matrix
\eqn{V^{-1}} are both implicitly subscripted by \eqn{\gamma}{gamma},
meaning that elements, rows, or columsn corresponding to gamma = 0
should be omitted.

\value{

  Returns an object of class \code{PoissonZellnerPrior}, which is a list
  with data elements encoding the selected prior values.  It inherits
  from \code{PoissonPrior} and from \code{SpikeSlabGlmPrior}, which
  implies that it contains an element \code{prior.success.probability}.

  This object is intended for use with \code{\link{poisson.spike}}.
